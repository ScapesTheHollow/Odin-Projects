Cream & Dairy: 80 ml cream, 1/3 cup curd (yogurt), milk (optional)

Basic Steps (Based on Restaurant-Style Recipe)
Prepare the Base: Sauté whole spices in ghee, then add onions, ginger, garlic, tomatoes, and nuts. Cook until soft, cool, then blend into a smooth paste. 
Strain & Cook Gravy: Pass the paste through a sieve. Return to pan, add water, salt, and spices. Simmer until thickened. 
Add Paneer: Gently fold in paneer cubes and cook on low heat for 2–3 minutes. 
Finish: Stir in cream, kasoori methi, and ground cardamom. Adjust seasoning and serve hot. 
Garnish: Top with fresh cream, chopped coriander, saffron, and dried rose petals for a royal touch. 
Tips
Soak paneer in hot water for 15–20 minutes before use to soften.
Use Kashmiri chili powder for vibrant red color and mild heat. 
For a richer taste, temper yogurt before adding to the gravy to prevent curdling.
Serve with naan, paratha, or basmati rice
