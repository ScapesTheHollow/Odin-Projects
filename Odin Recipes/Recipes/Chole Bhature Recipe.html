      <b>  Chole (Chickpea Curry) </b>
Soak 1 cup dried chickpeas overnight.  Pressure cook with 6–8 cups water, 2 tea bags, salt, and whole spices (cumin, bay leaf, cinnamon, cloves) for 4–5 whistles. Drain and reserve stock.
In a pan, sauté onions, ginger-garlic paste, and tomatoes until oil separates. 
Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, chole masala, amchur (dried mango powder), and anardana (pomegranate seeds).  Cook for 2 minutes.
Mix in the cooked chickpeas and ¾ cup reserved stock. Simmer for 8–10 minutes. Lightly mash for thickness. Add garam masala and fresh coriander before serving. 
<b> Bhature (Fried Bread)</b>
Mix 2½ cups maida (refined flour), ½ tsp baking powder, ¼ tsp baking soda, 2 tsp sugar, ½ tsp salt, and ½ cup yogurt. 
Knead into a soft dough with warm water. Add 1 tbsp oil and rest for 2–3 hours (or overnight for best rise). 
Divide into balls, roll into thick oval shapes. Deep fry in hot oil until puffed and golden.
